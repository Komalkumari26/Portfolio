          <h2>Hello, I'm Komal</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio! a Computer Science passionate about
            Software Development. Born and raised in Jharkhand, India, I
            developed a love for Sharing Knowledge and Teaching to others from a
            young age. I am pursuing my bachelor's degree from the Jharkhand
            University Of Technology, where I participated in different Programs
            and Organized Programs and also taught my Juniors how to take the
            right roadmap in one career. I believe that
            Hard work and Consistency lead to everyone's successful life, and
            this belief is reflected in my commitment to do more in my career
            field. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new ideas and talking to
            my Family members, which helps me be joyful and fresh-minded because
            Family is very Important. Currently, I am focusing on
            Problem-solving of DSA and enjoy doing coding every day.
          </p>
